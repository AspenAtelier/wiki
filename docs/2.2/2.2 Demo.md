The **Drehmal: Primordial** team released a demo of the 2.2 update on June 30, 2022. The demo includes the region around the spawn tomb, which features 4 towers (one of which is new), multiple settlements, and one of the new [[devotions]]. The demo also featured some previously teased features such as [[Artifacts]], [[Adventuring Merchants]], and the [[Runic Blacksmiths]].
