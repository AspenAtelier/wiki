# Devotion

**Devotion** is a new system coming with 2.2 that aims at giving more value to random loot items and introducing powerful options for the offhand slot.

Devotion represents the relation with the player to one of the three main deities or some of [[the Aspects]]. Each of them has its own devotion altars and rewards.

When the player finds a devotion altar, they can offer items to the deity or Aspects that is worshipped there to improve their devotion. Each deity/Aspect has their own list of loves, likes, dislikes, and hates. The player will have to figure out what these items are through the environment around them or through trial and error. Offering a deity/Aspect something they like will move the player closer to a rank-up. Offering them something they dislike will move them further away.

The first rank-up will grant a basic, unupgraded [[Relic]], that's specific to a deity/Aspect. Relics are a new item tier. They function as offhand items that give simple stat bonuses. Every three rank-ups will reward the player with an upgrade to your Relic. Other rank-ups grant themed items. For example, rank-up #1 grants a Relic, #2 is a themed item, #3 is another themed item, #4 is a Relic upgrade, #5 is a themed item, and so on. Most Relics can be upgraded all the way to +4, while some like Drehmalâ€™s only go up to +3. Once the player fully upgrade their Relic, they will have maxed out their devotion and can no longer give offerings.
