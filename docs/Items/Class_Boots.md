# Class Boots

Class boots are named boots given at the start of the map that provide small buffs. The boots can be upgraded using recipes found in the player's recipe book. Despite it seeming like a class pick is permanent, players can swap classes freely by changing one item in the recipes. This is feather/apple/bone for rogue/paladin/warrior accordingly.
