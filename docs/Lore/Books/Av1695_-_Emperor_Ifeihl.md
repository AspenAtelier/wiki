# Av1695 - Emperor Ifeihl

This book can be found in [[Sal'Mevir]].

> Ifeihl will be the end to this great empire. I know what he wants. He just wants power. He's going to resume the construction project and go after Maelihs, I swear. This technology will be the end of us all. I rejoiced when I heard that the project was halted. Everyone here tells me I'm just overreacting, I'm superstitious, and I'm too traditional. They don't understand the full capabilities of this energy.
>
> Whatever left the energy in that mountain would not be happy to know that we're stealing its power.
