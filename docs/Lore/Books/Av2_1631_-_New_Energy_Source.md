# Av2 1631 - New Energy Source?

Av2 1631 - New Energy Source? is found in [[Sal'Mevir]].

> We initially thought that the the energy source we detected almost 90 years ago was a fluke, a false alarm. We believed that the energy there was far too low for it to have any use. We may be wrong. A sample was taken from the mountain from a small (unauthorized) mining crew. This sample... ...is far beyond what we thought the mountain could hold. We will have to send more survey drones immediately.
