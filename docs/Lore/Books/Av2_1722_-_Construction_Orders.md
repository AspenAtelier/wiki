# Av2 1722 - Construction Orders

This book can be found in the [[Exodus Citadel]].

> Emperor Ifeihl has ordered the continuation of the construction on the energy collection facility. Construction has all but halted since 1690 due to the death of Drehn Mal'sohm, but our current Emperor disagrees with Mal'sohm's ways and thinks that this facility can be greatly beneficial to the empire as a whole. Blue Exodus has been requested to aid in the construction and defend the area from any attacks from natives. The Emperor says that workers in the facility have seemingly been going mad for an unknown reason, so if they pose a threat to anyone, we are to kill on sight. This seems extreme but the madness does not seem to go away and their minds are permenantly ruined.
