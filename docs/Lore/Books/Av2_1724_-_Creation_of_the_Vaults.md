This book can be found in an Avsohmic Vault on an island off the west coast of [[Casai]].

> Emperor Ifeihl, in the wake of the recent censoring of all information surrounding the Yavhlix facility, has ordered the construction of vaults that will store said information to keep it exclusive to higher ranking members of the Avsohmic government and certain organizations such as Blue Exodus. These vaults will also store other pieces of knowledge that are dangerous to the public, but the focus will be on the primary energy collection facility beneath Mt. Yavhlix and the applications of Primal Energy.
