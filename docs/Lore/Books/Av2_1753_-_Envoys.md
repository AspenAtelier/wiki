> Our great king has decided that, in order to gain and advantage over our rivals, is to try and gain land and join forces with the civilization that taken root in the Black Jungle. We should send envoys and see if they are willing to join forces. I have received word from the envoys. They were slaughtered by an army coming from the "Tidal Dynasty". Only one survived and made it back here to our outpost. Apparently, the Dynasty's ruler, the Tide Queen, recalls our old history where we sent prisoners to the mainland. She aims to "wipe us from history". Find by me. I'd rather stay our of mainland conflicts of I'm to be honest.
