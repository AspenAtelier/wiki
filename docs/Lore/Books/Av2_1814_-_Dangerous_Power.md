This book can be found in an Avsohmic Vault on an island off the west coast of [[Casai]].

> I have sent a letter to Emperor Anyr's desk to request the immediate termination of the Yavhlix operations due to the recent findings conducted by some of the facility's senior members. What lies beyond that rift in space time is beyond our comprehension and is something we have no business with. The power we are granted is immense, but with how little knowledge we have of the substance and its origins, I believe it is safe to say that we should stop its collection at once. Perhaps in the future, once we gain more information on the subject, we can restart the operation but it is in our best interest to cease any and all things regarding primal energy.
