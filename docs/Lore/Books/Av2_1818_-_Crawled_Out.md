# Av2 1818 - Crawled Out

Av2 1818 - Crawled Out can be found in [[Mt. Yavhlix]].

> A... thing? Clambered out of the portal. Very odd looking... almost alien, I'd say. It had a Drehmari-esque body but was smooth and slimey, covered in something that resembled black tar. It had no mouth, and simply moved its hands and sent... messages... directly to our heads.

> "You must leave. You must leave now."
>
> "He has noticed. He is displeased. Leave before He takes you."
>
> "You cannot kill Him. Nobody can. Nothing can."
>
> "You cannot know of Him. I will die soon. He will kill me."
