Av2 1820 - Evacuation Orders can be found in [[Mt. Yavhlix]].

> To all of my subordinates: We are to begin evacuation tomorrow morning. We detected massive fluctuations in energy coming from the portal. The Resonant Eye has started malfunctioning as well. All contact has been lost with those operating within the portal. We have no explanation for these events, but I assure you everything will be fine. The evacuations are simply a cautionary measure - one that hasn't happened in years, but still, the point stands.
>
> Thank you for your time.
