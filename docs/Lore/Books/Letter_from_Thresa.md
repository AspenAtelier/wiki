> Dear Gohri,
>
> What we've found down here is... I cannot even begin to describe it. I wish not to burden you with the knowledge of this discovery, but, perhaps in our future meeting we can discuss it. I know you've talked about wanting to die alongside me, so... but I'd hate to live with the knowledge that I doomed you. But I suppose it is necessary for our project.
>
> I think we'll call it the Primal Meltdown Plan... or something along those lines. I really hope I'm wrong with my hypothesis, because this whole thing is mortifying.
>
> Vehmil is in fact done with his work. He contracted a few workers to create the temporal stasis chamber at the Primal Caverns - why he chose that place is beyond me, to be honest. But apparently, it works.
>
> We just need to find some volunteers to get their memories wiped and sent to the chamber. A few people in my circle know of the plan and might be willing to volunteer.
>
> Glad to hear your work on avSYS has gone well. I'm sure the officers at the Exodus Citadel are quite lax with the whole thing - nobody is taking the Mythbreaker Protocols seriously, unfortunately.
>
> As for your meeting request... maybe, hopefully. I wish to see you again.
>
> Sincerely,
>
> Thresa
