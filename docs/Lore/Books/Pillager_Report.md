> I've received reports of pillagers from the [[The Verdant Labyrinth Region|Verdant Labyrinth]] moving into the old ruined castle on the black mountain northeast of here. Apparently its quite the formidable force. We'll have to assemble a squad of guard to take them out or persuade them to leave.

> I wonder why they've moved here. The group in the Labyrinth is practically a small army - they have a stranglehold on the area and plenty of resources. They're and extremely formidable force, but I don't see why they would expand to that old abandoned castle? Maybe they're looking for something. I've head rumors about that mountain hiding something within it, but they're just that - rumors.
