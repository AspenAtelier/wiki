> At long last - the Eye has decoded what lies in the center of that eye-shaped nebula. Unfortunately, due to how extremely dense the primal energy there is (also an amount hundreds of trillion times greater than the weapon we discovered), the image is incredibly blurry and full of static.

>
> Seems that it's really drained the Eye, moreso than usual. I guess its seen too much.
