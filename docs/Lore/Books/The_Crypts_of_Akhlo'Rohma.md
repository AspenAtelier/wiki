> During the time of Avsohm, a mass murderer known as the Lake Man struck fear into the hearts of the Drehmari. When he was captured, emperor Zorhis Ifeihl ordered the construction of a vast underground network of cells and tombs. Here, Avsohm would imprison and bury its greatest criminals.
>
> Unfortunately, due to frequent expeditions from both magical institutes and the Order of Insohm, the Crypts grew unstable and collapsed in on themselves. All that remains are a few buried entrances that lead to nothing but rubble. The most well-kept of these is said to be northwest of here, along the coast, hidden among the cliffs.
>
> The Crypts were a fascinating places of wisdom and learning that were unfortunately lost to time. Let it serve as a reminder that some knowledge has dire consequences.
