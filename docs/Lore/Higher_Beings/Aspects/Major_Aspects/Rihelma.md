--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Star-Rise Drake Rihelma** is the Aspect of Sky, and one of the four Elder Aspects alongside [[Khive]], [[Dahr]], and [[Taihgel]]. In addition to her dominion over the skies, Rihelma has uniquely potent powers of foresight, being able to commune with outside forces and create prophecies out of the futures that she sees.

## Characteristics
Rihelma takes the physical form of a large drake, a type of flying dragon. She is reffered to by the feminine "she" and "her" pronouns. 

## History 
As a Greater Aspect, Rihelma has existed in Drehmal since early av1. 

Rihelma is the author of seven prophecies known as the Facets. She is known to give out such enigmatic prophecies to mortals, aspects, and even beings from realms beyond Drehmal. 
In early av4, she "adopted" a group of Virmari on the Dawn Isles after Virtuo dissapeared. They renamed their home to The Star-Rise Bastion in her honor.
However, in very recent times she has stopped communicating with anyone in Drehmal.

## In-Game Interactions
Rihelma cannot be interacted with directly in-game, but her domain in Lo'Dahr includes one of the six trials.
