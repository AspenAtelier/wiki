# Higher Beings

According to the lore, powerful beings that govern the realm are responsible for many natural phenomena. Despite their inherent power, all higher beings are mortal.

## Aspects

Most higher beings in the realm of Drehmal fall under the category of Aspects. Aspects are reptilian deities who govern their own domains of nature, and some create children who inherit subcategories of their parent(s)’s jurisdiction. Aspects can be divided into two groups: Major and Minor Aspects.

### Major Aspects

Major Aspects are considered to be the most important Aspects and those with the broadest domains. All Major Aspects were created by the Primal Tree. A subcategory of the Major Aspects are the Elder Aspects (Khive, Dahr, Rihelma, Taihgel), who are deemed to be the most powerful. Major Aspects have devotion sites in-game.

### Minor Aspects

Minor Aspects are younger and less powerful Aspects, and are the children of Major Aspects. The exception to this is Lahrs, who was created by the Primal Tree and is the subject of debate for classification (Verrhys was also created by the Primal Tree, but they aren’t known to people in the modern day.)

When Avsohm fell, the military city of Sal'Anyr was attacked by Mael's forces, leaving only rubble and Anyr's tomb. This marked the beginning of the Dune Wars. |

## The Three Deities

Upon the felling of the Primal Tree, marking the beginning of the Second Avihm, three deities were born from it; Maelihs, Virtuo and Drehmal. Maelihs and Virtuo both take the form of large people, and historically they and their devotees have clashed with each other. Drehmal is a colossal serpent and the most powerful of the three deities, and is responsible for reshaping the land (which is now named after them) after the destruction of the old one from the First Avihm. Currently, Maelihs resides in Ytaj on Lo’Dahr, and his empire on Drehmal still thrives in the West. Virtuo is in Xivrhynt with her Grand Parish on a mission to thoroughly spread her purity across Drehmal. Drehmal has been slumbering deep underground beneath the Primal Caverns since the early Second Avihm, when they finished their task of recreation.
