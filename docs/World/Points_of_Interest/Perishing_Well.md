# Perishing Well

![[perishing_well.png]]

The **Perishing Well** is a small structure built into a mountain in western [[Casai]]. It is the sacred place and [[devotion]] site of [[Voynahla]], the Aspect of Death.

The actual shrine is located inside of the mountain, but it is most easily recognized by the broken red sandstone/acacia wood bridge that leads from it to the main western Casain mountain range.

First entering the structure grants the "Death's Embrace" advancement.

## Voynahla Devotion Guide

Around Voynahla's shrine, his lower-tier offerings can be found, including bones, dead bushes, and rotten flesh. To find his higher-level offerings, players must read the [[Greeting Death]] hint book nearby, which states:

> Be warned: you may be unable to wield the knife yourself. For this reason, you must always have a funeral plan wherever you go. Be **buried** at once **beneath Death's head with items** which will appease Voynahla's spirit. If you show no fear, you may yet be granted mercy.

A small nearby structure is the first of these hints. The large stone skull, decorated with four lit candles, is a representation of Voynahla's own head. Digging beneath it will reveal a chest with a higher-tier offering. These skulls are found throughout the realm, with at least five others known. They are almost always within sight of a graveyard.

??? warning "Voynahla Skulls"
    Voynahla skulls are also found in the [[Athrah]] graveyard, outside of the [[Mossfield]] and [[Firteid]] graveyards, at the bottom of the [[Dusps]] hill, and near [[Azaim]].

Like all other devotion sites, a [[Trinkets#Relic Vessel|Relic Vessel]] can be found here. In this instance, the relic vessel is found above a chiseled blackstone brick in the ceiling, over the broken walkway that leads to the main staircase.

## Lore

The Perishing Well has been a sacred place to Casain worshippers of Voynahla for many centuries, with worship of the Aspect of Death mostly born out of a desire to attain favorable reincarnation. It is mentioned in the [[The Casain Empire|historical account of the Casain Empire]], in which an emperor of the [[Casain Empire|empire]] visited the Perishing Well and received a prophecy that Casai would kill the [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms]]. According to the legends, this was the driving force behind Casain expansion into [[Anyr'Nogur]] and the Tharhan Plains, resulting in the [[War of Unification]] and creation of the [[Second Tharhan Empire]].

Today, it lies abandoned, as most of Casai has moved on to [[Virtuo]] worship. However, its keepers are stated to have left it in disrepair intentionally, espousing the belief that fixing the structure's bridge would be as foolish as attempting to evade death itself.

## Extras

The name "Perishing Well" is likely a play on the term "wishing well".
