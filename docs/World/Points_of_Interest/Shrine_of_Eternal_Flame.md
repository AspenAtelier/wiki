## Lai Devotion Guide

Lai's devotion altar is located in the center of the pyramid, along with the devotion hint book [[Getting Warmer|Getting Warmer?]]. Low-level offerings are strewn about the area, including gunpowder, campfires, and lanterns. The hint book leads to higher-level offerings, and reads:

> Kind Traveler,
>
> Though this sacred flame once burned longer and brighter than any other, it has sadly been extinguished.
>
> But there are still **many other sacred flames burning in Merijool**. If you find one, leave an offering to Lai **beneath**.
>
> Our faith is what stops this land from freezing!
>
> Signed, Pilgrim of the South

Better offerings can be discovered underneath the multicolored flames present throughout western Merijool.

Like all other devotion sites, there is a [[Trinkets#Relic Vessel|Relic Vessel]] to be found here. This location's relic vessel is found in a chest on top of the ziggurat.

## Lore

The advancement for finding the area reads: "The devout say that one sacred flame from the realm's very creation was maintained in Merijool even through the Felling. Civil war has a way of putting an end to local traditions." This strongly implies that this site was once home to a truly eternal flame, but conflict within Merijool (presumably between the West and East) extinguished it. This may have been a recent conflict, possibly one that immediately preceded the unification of Merijool in Av4 26.

The "Pilgrim of the South" who authored the devotion hint book also wrote the [[A Cozy Nook]] book, found at a small shrine to the west. There, they name-drop Flamestoker Ghulak, making it likely that this pilgrim was a [[Maelmari]] devotee of Lai from the city of [[Rhaveloth]] far to the south. This further bolsters the ties between the Maelmari and Lai, as the latter is the only [Aspect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) that the Maelmari worship alongside [[Maelihs]].
