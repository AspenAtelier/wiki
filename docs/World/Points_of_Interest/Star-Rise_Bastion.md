# Star-Rise Bastion

![[starrise_bastion.png]]

**Star-Rise Bastion**, or **Starrise Bastion**, is a fortress built atop a mountain on the [[Island of Dawn]], and the [[devotion]] site for [[Rihelma]]. 

It is home to a group of converted [[Virmari]] who began to worship the Sky Aspect after the departure of [[Virtuo]]. These Virmari, now calling themselves **Star-Kin**, are hostile to the player, and the structure is more of a true dungeon than some other devotion sites. This is the only place in the map where multiple Virmari (or "true" Virmari) are found.

Entering the bastion for the first time grants the "Place of Conversion" advancement.

## Rihelma Devotion Guide

Rihelma's shrine is located on the upper floor of the bastion, overlooking the sea to the north of the island. Around it are scattered low-level devotion offerings: copper ingots, feathers, and truesight (spectral) arrows. The hint book nearby, [[Crystalline Refractions]], reads:

> Shortly after the Abandonment and our Celestial Rebirth, the Goddess of the Endless Sky began to speak to us in prophecy. **Star-crowned crystals** erupted all around the island, and **within** were images of Truth. We must acquire the depicted objects to appease our great-winged Mistress!

Crystals throughout the island, which have extra special swirling patterns around them, contain higher-tier offerings.

Increasing devotion to Rihelma gives players the following rewards. Of note, Rihelma is the only god in the devotion system who has more than 10 devotion reward levels, requiring slightly more offerings to reach max devotion.

Rihelma is unique among the gods in that she does not have one singular [[relics|relic]] which upgrades over the course of her devotion path. Rather, she has four variations on a [[Relics#Rihelma Mirrors|set of mirrors]], which give different status effects to fired arrows when held.

Like all other devotion sites, a [[Trinkets#Relic Vessel|Relic Vessel]] can be found here. This relic vessel is located in an underground mushroom-themed room behind double iron doors, under a chiseled stone brick.

## Lore

The warriors of the bastion were devout [[Virmari]] followers of [[Virtuo]] for centuries, living in service of the Goddess at the edges of the realm. At this time, the fortification was known as **Dawnspire Bastion**. 

The departure of Virtuo at the end of the Third Avihm was a shocking and heartbreaking event for the Virmari left behind, some of whom took their own lives out of despair. However, at this time, they were visited by [[Rihelma]], who inspired them to keep living as her own devotees. This is described in [[Behold, Starrise Bastion]]. From this point on, the Virmari lived as "Star-Kin", and devoted themselves to their new mistress, even wiser and older than Virtuo. 

Unfortunately, very close to the time that the player arrives, the inhabitants of the fort were visited by Rihelma for the last time. As recounted in [[Diary of a Star-Kin]], Rihelma told the people here that she would be leaving for [[Lo'Veruhkt]] permanently, citing a massive upheaval of their world on the horizon.
