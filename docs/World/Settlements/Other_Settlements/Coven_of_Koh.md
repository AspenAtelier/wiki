The settlement is built inside of a mountain, with a stone brick path leading from its entrance to a small dock on the northwestern coast.

## Layout

The Coven of Koh is a small settlement, with only one entrance. Immediately upon entering, players will find a large crystal that runs from the ceiling to the ground, with paths branching off in three directions. To either side are staircases that lead upward to living quarters, while there is a large dining hall straight ahead. In this main hall, the [[Artifacts#Starpiercer|Starpiercer]] artifact pickaxe can be found, behind a black stained glass wall to the right.

Further back, players will find a small kitchen, a library room, and a stone tunnel that leads to a room with a [[Runic Catalyst]]. Another catalyst is found in the left (eastern) bedrooms, on the upper level, back near the entrance.

## Lore

The Coven of Koh's origins are not clear, but it is known that they existed by late Av2 due to their contact with the priests of [[Xor'Huul]]. It is possible that they either originated from a separate Casain voyage to the northern seas, were survivors of the [[Felling]] in the Av1 precursor to the Island of Dusk, or were a group that left the Xorhai.

The [[Unholy Ritual of Stone|ancient rite]] which those Xorhai priests used to attempt to become [[Aspect Ascended|Kohmari]] was brought back to Xor'Huul from the Coven of Koh, even though the two sides did not fully agree in their beliefs. It seems that the Coven of Koh was less radical than the priests of Xor'Huul in their desire to grow closer to the Aspect of Stone, and would not have approved of this attempt to become Koh's ascended.
