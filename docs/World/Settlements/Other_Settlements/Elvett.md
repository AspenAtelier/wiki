**Elvett** is a small settlement in the far western [[Ebony Veldt]], sitting below the base of the bridge that leads into the [[Foundry]].

    Approximate Coordinates: `-3179, 68, 1286`

Elvett is home to a few lore books and a [[Runic Blacksmith]]. It can be thought of as two towns: New Elvett, the currently-standing buildings, and Old Elvett, the sandstone ruins that surround the modern village.

## Layout/Points of Interest

Elvett sits on both sides of a river that runs west from the base of [[Mt. Ebonfire]] to the ocean. Its newer buildings are made of jungle and spruce wood, with cut copper roofing.

The area's Runic Blacksmith, who sells [[Artisan Items#Elvett|three artisan items]], is located in a small house in the northern half of the settlement. Most buildings are very similar, small homes, with one windmill building in the north and animal pens to the south. 

The sandstone ruins around the town are what remains of Old Elvett. One such building in the south has a chiseled sandstone block, which hides a basement. In this basement, players can find the [[The Omen]] book.

## Lore

The town of Elvett may have initially been a part of a Tharhan kingdom or empire, although the land in the Ebony Veldt was not settled until the time of the [[Second Tharhan Empire]]. Under [[Avsohm]]'s rule of the continent, the [[Foundry]] was created in the land nearby to test and produce Avsohmic weaponry. It is possible that Elvett was founded as a town for workers at the Foundry to live in, as suggested by the "The Omen" book found here.

Following the empire's collapse, the town's inhabitants have simply lived in the shadow of the bridge, with its true purpose eventually being lost to time. 

Today, it appears that Elvett is dominated by three feuding families, as referenced in the three [[Artisan Items#Elvett|artisan items]] sold in this town: the Hazej family of hunters, the Ehgod family of masons, and the Gidi family of chimney sweepers.
