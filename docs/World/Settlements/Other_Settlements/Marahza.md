First entering Marahza grants the "Flower Power" advancement.

## Layout

Marahza is a small village, comprising only eight buildings in total. Each of these buildings is, in some way, a greenhouse, themed around growing a different kind of flower or crop, and often themed around a color. Buildings are all built of birch wood (usually stripped) and waxed cut copper.

A statue of [[Vayniklah]] herself sits at the western end of the village, with a fountain in the center of the town. The Temple of the Bloom and Bough is located at the eastern end of the circle.

## Vayniklah Devotion Guide

Around Vayniklah's shrine are item frames with her low-level devotion offerings: cactus blocks, eggs, and sunflowers. The nearby hint book reads:

> To worship Vayniklah is to improve life for the living. Just as plants are happier with fertilizer, Drehmari are happier with mead! To that end, I told my friends to find the best possible **recipe**. Now, itâ€™s time to go across Akhlo'Rohma and **visit their stills**. I am sure that their ingredients will please Her!

Throughout Akhlo'Rohma, stills of mead such as the one found just outside this building (made of basalt and slate) can be found, and a high-level offering is hidden inside each of them.

??? info "Hint Locations"
    There are 6 of these kegs in the region, found at the following locations: a [[Maelmari]]-occupied house in the southwest, the basement of [[Ancehl Castle]], [[Dusps]] near the Northern Kitchen restaurant, [[Marahza]] very close to the Temple of Bloom and Bough, on an isolated plateau in the northeast, and [[Akhlo'Rohma#Esipelli Vineyard|Esipelli Vineyard]].

## Lore

The history of this village in particular is unclear, but it is seen from the [[Diahn's Woes]] book found here that there was contact between Marahza and the [[Tehrmari]] living in [[Purity Peaks]], at some time.
