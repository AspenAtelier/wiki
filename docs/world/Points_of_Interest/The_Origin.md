The Origin is a crypt-like location where the player appears after selecting a class. It includes an brief explanation of the gods of the world and a depiction of various events. Its entrance is located in the middle of the [[Capital Valley]] [region](/Regions), on top of a hill. There are a few chests with various early-game items inside and a button to receive a stone pickaxe.

The player can then return to Origin at any time to change their class.
